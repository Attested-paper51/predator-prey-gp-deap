# predator-prey-gp-deap
This research project aims to modify the artificial  ant into a predator-prey application using Genetic Programming  in DEAP. The methodology involves creating a predator-prey  environment, defining the behaviors (language) of predators  and prey, as well as outputting trace files to visualize the  predator’s path.
